Self studying CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning

This repo will contain only solutions of code and written problems.

All of the material could be downloaded from [course website](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/syllabus.html)

# notes
* In `assignment1/get_datasets.sh`, we need to change the url into http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip in order to get `glove.6B.50d.txt`.
* In my assignment1 implementation, the running time of `q3_run.sh` is 7009 seconds. The problem sheet says an efficient implementation takes approximately an hour, so maybe there are some better implementation.
